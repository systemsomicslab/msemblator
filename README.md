# Msemblator: A reliable annotation tool for metabolomics data
## Overview
Msemblator is a metabolomics annotation tool that integrates results from multiple in-silico annotation tools and applies ensemble learning-based scoring to provide highly reliable annotations.

Users can input **MSP files generated by MS-DIAL** and perform **formula prediction, structure prediction, or both**.

# Usage examples
## 1. Formula elucidation only
If you only want to perform formula prediction (no SIRIUS account required):

``` PowerShell
python main.py \
  --input data/example.msp \
  --output results/formula_only \
  --mode 1
```

## 2. Formula + structure elucidation (Recommended)
Run **both formula and structure prediction**, including ensemble scoring. Requires SIRIUS credentials:

``` PowerShell
python main.py \
  --input data/example.msp \
  --output results/formula_and_structure \
  --mode 2 \
  --sirius_user your_email@example.com \
  --sirius_pass your_password
```

## 3. Structure elucidation only
If your MSP file already contains predicted formulas and you want to perform **only structure annotation**. Requires SIRIUS credentials:

``` PowerShell
python main.py \
  --input data/formula_predicted.msp \
  --output results/structure_only \
  --mode 3 \
  --sirius_user your_email@example.com \
  --sirius_pass your_password
```

### Notes
・ `--input`: Path to the input MSP file (recommended: exported from MS-DIAL)
・ `--output`: Output folder to save results
・ `--mode`: 
   ・ 1 = Formula elucidation only
   ・ 2 = Both formula and structure elucidation
   ・ 3 = Structure elucidation only
・ --sirius_user and --sirius_pass : Required only for modes 2 and 3

## Input file preparation
Msemblator does not support raw data as input. Instead, **MSP files processed with MS-DIAL 5** are strongly recommended. The application utilizes MS-DIAL's MSP output to perform **formula and structure predictions**.

・ Formula prediction requires at least **m/z, MS2, Peak ID, and adduct type**.
・ **Structure prediction** requires the above information plus a **predicted molecular formula**.
・ If formula information is missing, structure prediction will be skipped. However, this limitation can be resolved by performing both formula and structure predictions simultaneously.

## Output files
Msemblator generates two output files:
1. A file containing **the top 3 predictions** from each annotation tool for both formula and structure, along with **the highest-ranked annotation based on the ensemble scoring model**.
2. A file summarizing **the top 3 ranked predictions from the scoring model**.

This structured approach ensures that users obtain high-confidence annotations from their metabolomics data.

## Environment setup
### 1. Python version:
This tool has been tested with:
```
Python 3.12+
```

Check your version:
``` PowerShell
python --version
```

### 2. Install required python modules
Install required Python packages using pip:
``` PowerShell
cd msemblator 
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Required External Tools
Some external tools are required for formula and structure prediction.
**・MS-DIAL(for MSP generation)**
Download:[MS-DIAL5](https://systemsomicslab.github.io/compms/msdial/main.html)
Export your data as .msp using MS-DIAL 5.
These MSP files will be used as input for this tool.

**・ SIRIUS (required for formula and structure elucidation)**
Download:[SIRIUS 5.8.6](https://github.com/sirius-ms/sirius/releases/tag/v5.8.6)
You will need:
・ The SIRIUS executable
・ A SIRIUS web service account
**・ MS-FINDER (required for formula and structure elucidation)**
Download:[MSFINDER3.60](https://github.com/systemsomicslab/MsdialWorkbench/releases)

**・ MetFrag (required for structure elucidation)**
Download:[MetFragCommandLine-2.5.0.jar](https://github.com/ipb-halle/MetFragRelaunched/releases/tag/v2.5.0)
